# 🌱 Land Vitality Management System

> A soil health management system that analyzes soil samples using sensor-based biochemical reactions, recommends fertilizers, and connects farmers with expert consultants.

---

## 📑 Project Overview
The **Land Vitality Management System** is a project developed as part of the **Software Requirement Engineering** course.  
The main goal of this project was to **collect, organize, and document detailed software requirements** for a real-world inspired system.

It focuses on:
- Analyzing soil health (pH, moisture, nutrients) through sensors.
- Recommending suitable fertilizers based on analysis results.
- Enabling farmers to consult agricultural experts through a secure platform.
- Promoting sustainable farming, increasing crop yield, and ensuring long-term land productivity.
